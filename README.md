# PiCollector

**Helping developers effortlessly collect and refine training data for self-driving applications.**

## Overview
PiCollector is a modern and intuitive data collection platform designed to streamline the process of gathering synchronized image and steering angle data for machine learning applications, particularly for self-driving RC cars. This project aims to simplify the data collection process, making it accessible even for non-technical users.

The application runs headlessly on a Raspberry Pi, providing a sleek web interface accessible via a phone or laptop on the local network. Users can configure camera setups, connect gyroscopic devices (e.g., smartphones), and collect labeled data efficiently at customizable frame rates. 

## Current Status
This project is in its **very early prototype stage** and is still in active development. Core features and functionalities are being planned, including:
- Live data collection with image preview and gyroscope integration.
- Session management for starting, stopping, and reviewing data collection.
- A built-in editor for refining and labeling collected data.
- An intuitive setup wizard for configuring connected cameras and devices.

## Vision
The ultimate goal of PiCollector is to provide a versatile and user-friendly tool for developers and hobbyists to collect high-quality training data for machine learning models. The project is being built to support individual needs and has the potential to grow into a broader solution for similar use cases.

## Contributing
While the project is not yet ready for public contributions, feedback and suggestions are welcome to help shape its development. Stay tuned for updates as the prototype evolves!

## License
The project will be released under a license that encourages reuse, modification, and commercial use, provided derivative works remain open source. The specific license is under consideration and will be finalized soon.
